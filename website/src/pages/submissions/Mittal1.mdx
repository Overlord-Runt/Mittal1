# Mittal1

The Mittal1 is my macropad for hackpad. It uses a 3x4 matrix with an encoder in the corner. It also has a 128x32 oled screen. I wanted to add a slider but QMK doesnt support them and I was not going to learn kmk for it.
## Features:
- Bunch of anime references written on it
- 128x32 OLED Display
- EC11 Rotary encoder for whatever you want
- 11 keys
- TEAM SKY!!!!


## CAD Model:

The Mittal1 has 2 parts that are screwed together in a integrated plate mount. it has a bunch of anime references and quotes all around it, as well as the team sky logo from mandjtv on youtube(go check him out, he is awesome)

My case is a dark red colour with black keycaps

I made the whole thing in Shapr3D since my computer is too weak to run fusion. so thats cool I guess

## PCB
Here's my PCB! It was made in KiCad. the oled is connected with wires and placed in the middle.

schematic is the same as any normal one

the pcb isnt actually 19.05mm apart. i just eyeballed it and i wish i hadnt. Its very noticeable that the gaps are uneven.

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) firmware for everything. 

- the rotary encoder changes volume. press to mute
- the 11 keys have various keyboard commands like copy, paste, find, and cut. I do this because I always forget half of my keyboard commands
- The OLED is a refernce to my friend Alivetin who is just a tin can

## BOM:
Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad

- 11 MX Cherry Red switches
- 12 1n4148 diodes
- 1 ec11 rotary encoder with switch
- 1 xiao rp2040
- 1 128x32 i2c oled 0.91 inch (pls dont solder this)
- 1 pcb
- 2 4.7k resistors
- 12 DSA Keycaps
- 4 M3x5x4 Heatset inserts
- 4 M3x16mm Bolts
- Case(2 3d printed parts)
- Box signed by alex



## Funny
I spent a lot of time making this and had to make like 3 different versions of my case because I kept messing up.

The current version probably also has a messed up space for the oled but I will fix it once i get my parts and get the actual dimentions of it

Join #taran-does-stupid-things cuz its my personal channel and you get to see me make cool stuff(named #pochita-cult-gang for a limited time).
